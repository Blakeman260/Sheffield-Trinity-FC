                    add up, to everything this club desires to be.

                    <b>In the beginning:</b><br>
                    <p  id="beginning">The football club was set up in May 2008 by Andy Hoyland and Iain Atkins.The initial idea came about when Iain asked Andy if 
                    he would be interested in setting up an 11 a side church football team based around St. Johns church, Owlerton and Christ Church,
                    Hillsborough and  Wadsley Bridge. Andy was very interested so they investigated appropriate leagues to meet the proposed club ethos. 
                    They identified a Saturday morning league known as the Sheffield and District Fair Play League (SDFPL) and approached it for membership.
                    It looked as if the team would have to play a season of friendlies, and the pair were organising this, when a league place became 
                    available subject to the application process.  They viewed this as the football team was meant to be and that now was the right 
                    time and place to do it. The club then played three friendlies against Hope City, HSBC and Zion New Boyz, all of which they 
                    unfortunately lost, but the good news was that the club was accepted into the SDFPL league for the 2008 – 2009 season. </p>

                    <b>The club name:</b><br>
                    <p  id="club-name">The football club was originally planned to be called Sheffield Saints. ‘Sheffield’ to indicate where most of the team live, grew up and 
                    play their football, ‘Saints’ to express the church links of the club. However, this name wasn’t to be as another new club in the SDFPL 
                    had a similar name ‘Yorkshire New Saints’ and the names were deemed too similar. The current name came into being after being suggested 
                    by an unlikely source. He was proposing various names but couldn’t find anything that suited the club. However his grandma, Madge Shepherd, 
                    suggested the name ‘Sheffield Trinity’. ‘Sheffield’ because of the Sheffield base, 
                    and ‘Trinity’ because the Trinity is the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.</p><br>

                    <b>The Ethos:</b><br>
                    <p  id="ethos">The football club plays in a competitive league and wants to win games and progress.
                    "Winning is not everything, but the effort to win is." (Zig Ziglar).
                    However, it also wants to be a part of the players lives, providing an opportunity for people to meet, enjoy their football, socialise 
                    together and accept their differences in ability, race, age and use them to benefit each other and the team.
                    "The nice thing about teamwork is that you always have others on your side." (Margaret Carty)</p><br>
